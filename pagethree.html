                    <p>Omnivores are animals that eat both animals and plants. This type of animal has the advantage of a wide selection of food to satisfy their hunger and dietary needs, with some scientists calling them “opportunistic eaters”. This means that they can and will eat almost anything that is around when they are hungry.</p>

                    <p>Omnivores also have the benefit of being able to find food at any time of year because they will eat the food that is available. For example, an omnivore will eat fruits and nuts growing on plants during the summer, and it will also hunt for meat during other seasons of the year. Because omnivores eat almost any type of food, they have many different types of teeth. These animals have incisors in the front for cutting, canines which help to tear up meat and molars in the back of their mouths to grind up food.</p>

                    <p>Bears are an example of a big omnivore, they hunt animals during any season when they need to eat. Raccoons and pigs are examples of medium-sized omnivores. Many birds eat both insects and berries, making them omnivores. Omnivores live in every type of environment, including deserts, forests, water, and even the arctic.</p>
