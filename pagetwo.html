                    <p>Herbivores are animals that only <strong>eat plants</strong>.<br>They often concentrate on just the fruits or seeds of plants, ignoring stems, leaves, and roots.</p>

                    <p>Herbivores have special digestive tracts that are designed to handle different types of plants they might eat and they usually have big front teeth, called incisors.<br>These teeth are used to grasp and cut plants. Herbivores also have molars in the back, which they use to grind up the plants in their mouths.</p>

                    <p>Herbivores are often very large animals, such as cows, deer, and elk. It takes a lot of food to give a large herbivore the energy it needs, so that is why they may spend a large part of their day eating.<br>Herbivores can also be medium-sized animals such as sheep or goats, but other examples of small herbivores include squirrels and chipmunks.</p>
