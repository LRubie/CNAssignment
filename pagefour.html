                    <p>Carnivores are mammals that only <strong>eat</strong> the meat of <strong>other animals</strong>. In the wild, a carnivore will hunt other animals for food.<br>Carnivores usually have to eat a lot to give them the energy they need, so sometimes these animals have to spend most of their days hunting to make sure they get enough food.</p>

                    <p>Because carnivores need to cut and tear up their food, they have big canine teeth and sharp molars, they also usually have small incisors in the front of their mouths.<br>Big carnivores include lions, tigers, and wolves. Some birds such as hawks and eagles are also carnivores. Snakes are usually carnivores as well.</p>

                    <p>Small carnivores include frogs, birds such as robins, and spiders. Carnivores provide an important service in the wild because they help control the population of other animals. If carnivores were not hunting and removing these animals from environments, these animals could overpopulate an area.</p>
